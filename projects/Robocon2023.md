## Overview

ABU ROBOCON 2023 was a continuation of our competitive robotics efforts, focusing on high-speed coordination, robust embedded control, and reliable mechanical actuation under match conditions.

## My Role

I contributed primarily to **embedded electronics, PCB design, and control implementation**, while also supporting system integration and on-field debugging during competition phases.

## Technical Contributions

- Designed and validated ESP32-based control electronics
- Developed embedded firmware in C for real-time actuator control
- Assisted in PCB bring-up, testing, and fault isolation
- Supported integration between sensing, actuation, and control subsystems
- Participated in system-level testing and competition readiness

## Outcome

- Successfully competed at **ABU ROBOCON 2023**
- Improved system robustness compared to previous season
- Gained deeper experience in competition-grade robotics engineering
