While at Hook EV Systems, I was tasked with the design and implementation of the core embedded electronics for the EV bicycle conversion kit, with a focus on compactness, connectivity, and secure access. The system’s purpose was to enable any conventional bicycle to be converted into an electric bicycle with real-time data connectivity and intuitive mode selection.
