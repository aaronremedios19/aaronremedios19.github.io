## Overview

ABU ROBOCON 2022 was an international robotics competition focused on multi-robot coordination, precision actuation, and real-time control. Our team represented **St. Francis Institute of Technology**, competing at the national level.

## My Role

I worked primarily on **electronics design, embedded control, and system integration**, contributing to both hardware and software development across multiple robots.

## Technical Contributions

- Designed and integrated ESP32-based embedded control systems
- Developed custom PCBs for motor control and sensor interfacing
- Implemented control logic in Embedded C for coordinated robot motion
- Worked on mechanism control for ball passing, shooting, and tower reconstruction
- Assisted in system debugging, testing, and competition readiness

## Outcome

- Successfully represented SFIT at **ABU ROBOCON 2022**
- Gained hands-on experience in large-scale competitive robotics systems
- Strengthened skills in embedded systems, controls, and rapid prototyping
